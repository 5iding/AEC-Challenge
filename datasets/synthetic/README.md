The synthetic dataset provides 10,000 examples representing single talk, double talk, near end noise, far end noise, and various nonlinear distortion situations. 
Each example includes a far end speech, echo signal, near end speech and near end microphone signal clip. 
The clips can be linked by the fileid_{int} attribute.
The meta.csv file includes information about the synthesis parameters such as source clip ids, speaker ids and signal-to-echo ratios.
