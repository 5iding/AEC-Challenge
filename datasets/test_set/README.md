# Initial Testset for AEC Challenge


## Noisy Recordings
* The noisy recordings folder includes a random subset of real world recordings from four scenarios (single-talk and double-talk with- and without movement).

## Clean Recordings
* The clean recordings folder includes a set of real world recordings where audio quality of nearend single-talk speech was rated to be MOS 4 or higher by an P.808 test. Additionally, the files have been processed with Wiener filter based noise suppression and AGC.  Like the noisy dataset, it includes four scenarios: single-talk and double-talk with- and without movement.
